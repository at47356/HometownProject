            Birmingham Canals
          </h1>
          <p class="cardtext">
            Birmingham has 35 miles of canals, which is said to be more than
            Venice. They're enjoyed by walkers, cyclists, and narrowboat owners
            and they are a reminder of a unique industrial history. During the
            Industrial Revolution the canals were busy waterways transporting
            coal, iron and other heavy goods. They played a crucial role in the
            development of Birmingham and the Black Country. More than 100 miles
            of canals make up the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) today. Some
            of the major canals that meet in the city are the Grand Union Canal,
            Worcester and Birmingham Canal, Stourbridge Canal and Stratford Canal.
